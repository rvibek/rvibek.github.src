### Workflow Overview
The production stack looked like this:

**Content Outlining:** [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/) was used to outline all 10 episodes. Its conversational interface helped refine structure and ensure narrative flow across episodes.

**Script Writing:** Once outlines were locked in, Gemini was again used to generate the detailed transcripts. The results were surprisingly coherent, needing only minimal edits.

**Audio Generation:** To convert scripts into audio, I used [Notebook LLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). Due to quota limits, I had to switch between multiple Google accounts during this phase.

**Thumbnail Generation:** For episode artwork and thumbnail visuals, I used [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).
