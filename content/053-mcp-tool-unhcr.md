Summary: I built mcp_tool to experiment with MCPâ€”Model Context Protocol using UNHCRâ€™s Refugee Population Statistics, got it running with a little help from Manus.

Lately Iâ€™ve been hearing a lot of buzz around <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools" target="_blank"><strong>MCPâ€”Model Context Protocol</strong></a> â€” and, I had to check it out. A few videos, some docs later, I was in deep.

Thatâ€™s when I ended up building my first `mcp_tool` that interacts with <a href="https://api.unhcr.org/docs/refugee-statistics.html#api-Default-population" target="_blank">UNHCRâ€™s Refugee Population Statistics</a>. The code lives in my GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/rvibek/mcp_unhcr" target="_blank">rvibek/mcp_unhcr</a>, and I even spun up a live server version here: <a href="https://smithery.ai/server/@rvibek/mcp_unhcr" target="_blank">smithery.ai server</a>. I built it with some help from <a href="https://manus.ai" target="_blank">Manus</a> â€” yep, that pretty wild AI sidekick everyoneâ€™s talking about.

The idea behind `mcp_tool` was just to experiment and get a feel for how MCP works, so I picked up the UNHCR RDF as a real-world dataset to try it out with.

The code itself is pretty simple â€” just some scripts, a bit of config magic, and that MCP layer tying it all together. Manus handled most of the heavy lifting. I had to jump in for some refactoring and troubleshooting â€” ran into a few errors, of course. After five failed deployments ðŸ˜…, I finally got it running.

Now Iâ€™ve got it plugged into Cline in VSCode, and itâ€™s starting to feel like a real little dev assistant setup. Still early days, but itâ€™s been a fun ride so far.

## How to test MCP project locally

The easy way to get started - install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), modern python package manager.

```bash

uv init mcp-server
cd mcp-server
source .venv/bin/activate

## add dependencies
uv add "mcp[cli]" requests

## run app.py
mcp dev /path/to/app.py

```
The server should start on the port 6274
